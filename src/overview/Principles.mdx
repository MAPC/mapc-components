# Principles

## CORE CONSIDERATIONS

The following are core considerations for qualities to consider in the addition and implementation of MAPC Components:

- Easy for developers to implement and integrate into new projects
- Easy for designers to understand and test
- Easy to customize and style with theming
- Compatible with other components
- Independent and free from external dependencies
- Use and then customize [React Bootstrap]() where possible

## Interactivity/patterns/"juice"

- Components in the library should account for the many common interaction states that occur on the web, namely:
  - Active/selected
  - Hover
  - Loading
  - onMouseDown, onClick
  - Disabled
  - Error
  - Warning
- Components that depend on state/data should offer a consistent and accommodating set of data structures to support those interactions
  - For buttons connected to a network request for data from an API, for example, we should establish a way of representing these states:
  - In addition to the various states a component can be in, we should also provide a mechanism for showing displayable error messages (originating either from the front-end or the server)
    - Toasts (like https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/components/toasts) can be used for both durable and transient messages
    - Flash messages (a la Rails (https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html) and Django (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/messages/)) can also be used for transient messages
  - We should also try to cache data whenever it make sense, so we should also provide a means to let the user force a refresh (manually busting the cache) if desired
  - We should also be able to handle paginated results, and potentially infinite-scroll

## STRUCTURE AND FORMATTING

Defines how to organize the structure of documenting a component in MAPC Components:

- It should define all dependencies
- It should define all parameters, and all required data fields
  - ideally should be generalizable for use across datasets
- It should be written in Javascript
  - Opting for Javascript in lieu of Typescript for streamlined development of new projects. May need to define individual typing to integrate with Typescript projects
- It should have a well-thought-out name that is intuitive yet eliminates ambiguity as to its function
