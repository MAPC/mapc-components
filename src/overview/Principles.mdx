# Principles

## CORE CONSIDERATIONS

The following are core considerations for qualities to consider in the addition and implementation of MAPC Components:

- Easy for developers to implement and integrate into new projects
- Easy for designers to understand and test
- Easy to customize and style with theming
- Compatible with other components
- Independent and free from external dependencies

## STRUCTURE AND FORMATTING

Defines how to organize the structure of documenting a component in MAPC Components:

- It should define all dependencies
- It should define all parameters, and all required data fields
  - ideally should be generalizable for use across datasets
- It should be written in Javascript
  - Opting for Javascript in lieu of Typescript for streamlined development of new projects. May need to define individual typing to integrate with Typescript projects
- It should have a well-thought-out name that is intuitive yet eliminates ambiguity as to its function
